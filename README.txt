This is a project with the goal of creating a command-line app
that will create a SVG of a dendrogram of the filesystem under
some directory, up to a recursion limit. The SVG will be 
rendered with D3 technology.


Game plan:

0. Investigate alternative filesystem viewing tech.
1. Figure out how D3 dendrograms work. 
2. See how to automate node to run D3 from command line.
3. Figure out a Python driver to extract required tree structure.
